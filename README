A fully dependency-free Java implementation of the Mustache templating language.
   http://mustache.github.com/

I don't love re-inventing things, but I needed this one to work for a crucial project,
and nothing I found out there did everything in the Mustache spec as designed, so I ended
up doing a clean-room implementation after hacking a little bit on forks of other people's code.

So as usual, standing on shoulders, etc.

`    import io.gamechanger.mustax.MustacheParser
    import io.gamechanger.mustax.MustacheTemplate
    import io.gamechanger.mustax.MapMustacheContext

    public class Foo {
        public static void main( String... args ) {
        }
    }
`
